<p>Ava's yellow beak flashed in the knife's gleaming glare.</p>
<p class="feature-italic">Be patient. You still need to tell Mom.</p>
<p>Her caregiver, Sarah, placed the salmon she had neatly cut in the
    feeding area of the towering walk-in cage. She stroked Ava’s silky
    feathers, then crawled her fingers to rest momentarily on Ava’s
    back. Busy with her food, Ava missed the concerned frown
    forming on Sarah's face.</p>
<p>Ava hatched in the Birds of Prey section of the zoo and had spent
    the five years of her life in the same enormous cage. Growing up,
    her mother, Osyka, had told her stories, memories, of what it was
    like to soar in the endless blue sky and to dive, to free-fall, through
    the air. Imagining the sensation and dreaming about it had
    occupied Ava day and night. She glanced at the knife again before
    Sarah picked it up and left the cage, the metal door screeching
    behind her.
    </p>
<p>Osyka perched patiently on the highest branch of the caged trees.
    She flew down to eat once Sarah left. While she took her time with
    every bite, Ava devoured her own share.
    </p>
<p>“Mom, I have a plan.” She flapped her wings, dancing around her
    mother.
    </p>
<p>Osyka turned to face her with stern eyes, beak half open.
</p>
<p>“Sarah's knife is our way out of here. If I grab it tomorrow
    morning, you'll be soaring through the skies again and I can know
    what it means to be me.”
    </p>
<p>“No.” Osyka continued to munch on the fish.</p>
<p>“Mom!” Ava craned her neck to face Osyka. “I've thought this
    through.”</p>
<p>“What if you get stuck in the net and hurt yourself? Besides, you
    don't even know how to live in that world.”
    </p>
<p>“You're going to be there with me.”</p>
<p>Osyka chortled, wiping her pale beak on the feathers of her
    shoulder. “Ava dear, even I've forgotten how to catch a fish after
    being fed for all these years. My wings are sore and tight. We won't
    make it out there.”</p>
<p>Ava sighed. “I will rip this cage open tomorrow and you're
    welcome to follow me.” She opened her wings and rose to the
    topmost branch where she usually passed the hours of the day
    observing the flying crows, hawks, and sometimes even fellow
    eagles. The free birds shared the sky without feeling crowded.
    They seemed oblivious to the caged ones and were preoccupied
    with their spiral dance. Their slanted, circular meditation mystified
    any onlooker, especially one who was fenced in.
    </p>
<p class="feature-separator">***</p>
<p>As night fell, Ava reviewed her plan, fluttering from one side of the
    cage to the other, tapping the network of wires with her beak to
    make sure she knew where it was most vulnerable. She
    remembered years of failed efforts when she had naively tried to
    cut the net open with her curved beak and talons and the day it
    had dawned on her that the straight steel knife was the appropriate
    tool.
    </p>
<p>Sarah walked inside, knife in one hand, dead rats in the other, but
    she was not alone. Moving aside the large ladder that was against
    the tall tree, she made space for the white-suited stranger.</p>
<p>Ava landed next to them, keeping her distance. She was busy
    envisioning the knife in her claws, when the new person
    approached her and, holding her firmly, examined her wings. She
    struggled to free herself, but relaxed when Sarah stroked her head.
    </p>
<p>“Yeah, there's definitely something there. She has maybe twentyfour hours left if we don't remove it.” The vet stood and continued,
    “The procedure's fairly straightforward. For wild ones, we're
    concerned about flight limitations, but it's not like this one needs
    to fly outside, and it won't restrict her in this cage.”
    </p>
<p>“Is she in pain?” Sarah held Ava's head in her hands and stroked
    her beak.</p>
<p>The vet shook his head. “That's the problem with this disease.
    They don't feel any pain until the very end. You were pretty sharp
    to notice the bump.”</p>
<p>Looking at Ava and patting her back, Sarah nodded. “Let's get it
    over with tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>Ava wriggled free and flew back to the top branch. Osyka wrapped
    her wing around her. “I should have known.” She looked away,
    tears of regret brimming her eyes. “Your father had it too. But
    there was no one to save him.”
    </p>
<p>“At least he knew what it was like to fly free.” Ava gazed at the
    netted indigo sky, dreaming about free falls that lasted forever.
    From the day her young feathers had whiffled to lift her, she felt
    cramped in the lofty cage.
    </p>
<p>“I can't stay here and never know.”</p>
<p>Osyka pecked the feathers below Ava's prominent eyes. “You don't
    have to. If you grab the knife, you'll have twelve hours to
    experience life in the open.” She lifted her daughter's chin with her
    bony beak. Ava's eyes resembled her father's; they were the only
    remnant of Osyka's untethered past. She stared into them and said,
    “Just remember, I'll be waiting for you tomorrow night.”</p>
<p class="feature-separator">***</p>
<p>When Sarah came the next morning, Ava spread her wide wings
    and floated down, the streak of brown feathers on her head
    fluttering in between the maturing white.
    </p>
<p>For weeks, she had studied the exact moment when Sarah placed
    the knife on the ground to arrange the fish slices. Today was no
    different; the moment the knife was set down, sending the glaring
    signal to Ava, she jumped at it and flew to the top of the cage
    where the net was most vulnerable.
    </p>
<p>“Ava come back!” Sarah climbed the ladder up the tallest tree.</p>
<p>Ava's attempts at slashing the angled net with the knife in her
    talons were futile. She placed the weapon on a wide branch to pick
    it up with her beak. Sarah, now on the last step, threw herself on
    the branch, reaching for the knife. Her fingers barely touched the
    blade. The knife tipped over and ripped through the air.</p>
<p>Ava looked at Sarah, wishing she could tell her somehow that she'll
    be back before nightfall. Sarah looked back pleadingly. For a
    moment, the young eagle wanted to take refuge in the arms that
    had cared for her for as long as she could remember, but this was
    her only chance to experience freedom.
    </p>
<p>Ava swooped towards the knife, grabbed the handle, and flapped
    her wings to pull the blade that was lodged in the ground. Sarah
    was back on the ground when the knife finally gave in and Ava
    zoomed back up. This time she went straight for the wide branch,
    placed the knife in her beak, and slashed the net until a large piece
    collapsed, missing Sarah's face by a few inches. Osyka calmly
    observed from the corner of the high branch as her daughter
    whizzed through the hole, barely missing the sharp thorns of the
    broken net.
    </p>
<p class="feature-separator">***</p>
<p>Ava stretched her wings, embracing the entire universe. Freedom
    roamed the hills around the zoo. Sheep and cattle, horses, even
    petty squirrels had more space than she had ever imagined. Ava
    glided over the small town, rising into cooler skies, then floating
    back down into the warm atmosphere of the orange-roofed
    houses. Now she knew, felt, why the birds she had observed every
    day spent tireless hours among the clouds. The sensation of
    weightlessly circling the skies was interwoven into her wings, her
    aerodynamic beak, her pointed tail. And though experiencing it for
    the first time, she had always known this sensation, the memories
    of her ancestors being preserved in her genes.</p>
<p>After a few hours of drifting, Ava tried to find the lake where her
    parents used to live. She discovered the potential of her eyes for
    the first time and spotted a lake in the middle of a forested area.
    Resting on top of a towering redwood, she noticed three eaglets on
    a nearby tree, daring each other to step to the edge of their nest.
    The braver one stepped up and attempted flight. The eaglet tried
    to keep himself lifted, but his miniature wings gave in to gravity
    and he hurtled down. Ava leaped to save him. The mother, who
    had been observing on another branch, dove for her baby,
    catching him only inches from the ground. Eaglet in her beak, she
    glared at Ava and flew back to the nest. Not long after, the father
    flew in with fresh trout in his beak.
    </p>
<p>So this is what a family looks like.</p>
<p>Waving her wings again, Ava approached the lake and focused her
    eyes. Her vision surprised her once again as she examined every
    little creature on the surface of the water from a mile above. She
    discovered a pattern in the movement of the fins. It was time to
    dive. As the air slipped over her beak, rippled through her feathers,
    and shot over her tail, she advanced on the fish and pierced the
    cool water with her talons. She missed. Splashing her wings against
    the refreshing surface of the lake, she regained elevation.
    </p>
<p>Ava plummeted towards the lake again, focusing more on
    developing her diving skills than on catching food. The excitement
    of free-falling had taken away all sense of hunger. Nevertheless,
    after many failed attempts, she clasped her talons around a
    slippery body and delivered it to a large rock.
    </p>
<p>A swoosh of wings startled her and in a glimpse of an eye, the fish
    was gone. The mother eagle was flying away with her catch. Ava
    sprang in the air and reached the rival bird, first hesitating then
    attacking her in mid-air, clasping her claws around the fish and
    pulling. Mother eagle pivoted and the birds were face to face, their
    talons entangled, the corpse slipping out.
    </p>
<p>“Give it back!”</p>
<p>“I don't want to see you around my nest again.”</p>
<p>“I was trying to save your baby!”</p>
<p>“My babies have a mother, show off!” Mother eagle dove and flew
    away to her nest, holding on to the fish.</p>
<p>Bewildered at the speed of events, Ava floated down to the rock
    again. She thought about the food that had always been set out for
    her, even cut into small pieces.
    </p>
<p>Her sharp talons yearned for the sensation of ripping through their
    prey. Ava took flight once again, this time going higher, focusing
    harder, diving faster, and piercing deeper into the cold water.</p>
<p>She brought a wrestling fish to the rock and knocked it out with
    her beak. Digging through the skin, she clawed at the champagnecolored meat. It surprised her, contrasting the vibrant pink offered
    to her every morning. She devoured the fish that carried in its
    flesh the taste of pride and accomplishment, something the
    luxuriously cut-up fish at the zoo lacked.
    </p>
<p>As Ava finished her belated lunch, the afternoon sun dried her wet
    feathers. She rose to the same redwood she had visited earlier.
    Perching on its highest branch, she wondered about all the life
    decisions of which the zoo had deprived her. Her contemplation
    was interrupted when a shiver ran through her back and her spine
    went into spasm.</p>
<p class="feature-italic">I have to head back before it's too late.</p>
<p>She looked around, taking in every little detail.</p>
<p class="feature-italic">Do you want to live in that cage knowing you can never truly fly again,
    dive again, even if you escaped?</p>
<p>The sun kissed the smooth surface of the lake. Ava opened her
    wings to fly back, but pain shot through to the very tip of her
    feathers. She swayed her neck to relieve some of the pain, but to
    no avail. Her brows united at the increased throbbing; she flew
    away anyway. Just a few flaps outside the forest she had to land on
    a high balcony to rest. A comforting chant was flowing out stainedglass windows.
    </p>
<p>“Laaaa-ilahaaa-ilalaah.”</p>
<p class="feature-italic">I have to go back. For Mom.</p>
<p>She took another leap. Agony accompanied every flap of her wings
    and blinded her vision. Her feathers had turned to rocks.
    Screeching into enclosing darkness, she made out the wooden
    entrance sign of the zoo amidst the town buildings.</p>
<p>Ava glided over the fenced areas, but consciousness failed her as
    she saw the net that she had ripped open earlier. She fell, freely for
    the last time, into the arms of a desolate Sarah, who was staring at
    the sky, the last drops of hope draining through her feet. Osyka
    shrieked from inside. Sarah laid Ava down and ran to get the vet.</p>
