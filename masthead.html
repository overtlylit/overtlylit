        <h1 class="about-title">Who is Overtly Lit?</h1>
        <p>Overtly Lit is run by two budding writers who aim to celebrate all things that meet at the intersection of faith and art.</p>
        <p>We want to see faith and spirituality explored creatively. Unfortunately, faith is often seen as something that must be hidden away, not spoken of. When spirituality and faith play such a large role in the lives of many, this attitude can lead to stifled creativity.</p>
        <p>But why the name Overtly? When submitting our own work to other online journals, we often came across the requirement:</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">'nothing overtly religious'</span></p>
        <p>This was a disheartening requirement to come across as writers of faith. While we respect other literary journals' choice to make this request, we wanted to create a space which celebrates faith in fiction and art. 
            We believe that being religious can come in many shades and flavours, and what might look spiritual to one might seem mundane to another. That's not for us to say, we simply want to experience the journey with you. </p>
        <p>So bring us your quiet moments and chilling revelations, your wild adventures and soothing lullabies. Bring everything that makes your art <span class="bold">Overtly You</span>.</p>

        <p>Madeehah is a pharmacist and writer from London, UK. She is currently studying for an MA in Creative Writing and has published several short stories and essays. Her work has been shortlisted for the Future Worlds Prize for fantasy and science fiction writers of colour.</p> 
        <p>Madeehah loves to read science fiction and fantasy, but is open to most genres. She's a fan of character-driven stories and beautiful prose. Madeehah has a current obsession with stories set in space, so a fun space opera + faith is a big YES! from her.</p>

She's fond of stories that explore magical realism and folklore and even more so when it incorporates faith. She'd be overjoyed to read submissions that delve into less explored history.</p>

Her poetry and prose is published in several literary journals including Mizna, Paper Darts, Khôra, Puerto Del Sol,Winter Tangerine, and elsewhere.

        <p>Sagirah loves reading and listening to a wide variety of poetry. She has a soft spot for purposeful lyric poetry and poems that challenge the conventional boundaries of language and storytelling. From visual poems to ghazals, Sagirah is looking for poems that innovate and resist. Submit your unruly, wild, loud, shy, sly, poetic creations. I want to be challenged. I want to see the heart of your truth transformed on the page.</p>
