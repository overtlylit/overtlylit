    <h4 class="sdl-tag">Salaam Dear Leila</h4>
    <p class="sdl-question">I find it hard to say no to people when they ask for 
        my help with their creative projects, even when I know I’ll be stretching myself. If I can be helpful to
        other people then I want to be so and I believe that Allah helps those who helps others. But there are
        times when I’ve said yes to too many things and I overwhelm myself and in order to meet all the
        commitments I’ve made, I end up neglecting my own creative projects.   </p>
        
        <p class="sdl-question">Part of why I don’t want to say no to people is that I
        don’t want to offend anyone or for them to feel like they couldn’t ask me again in the future and I also
        don’t want to be left with feelings of guilt. How can I go about saying no when I need to? </p>

  <div class="sdl-answer">
    <h4 class="sdl-tag">Dear Hafsa</h4>
    <p class="sdl-para">When I was growing up in Sudan, many people around me did
      not have their own personal comb, their own bed or their own
      towel. This was not because they were poor, but because they
      did not have a sense of individuality or exclusive ownership.
      Sharing things was their way of life. They felt so much part of
      their family, even the extended family that there was no sense
      of us versus me. And this attitude applied not only to material
      possessions but to effort and time. Time for oneself, ‘my’
      space, ‘my’ projects were alien concepts. As much as I loved
      reading as a child, I was aware that my self-absorption was
      often considered aloof, insular and elitist. In such a society,
      helping others was not even considered help. It was what one
      did, part of normality, the nature of life. But the world changes
      and so do people. We are not like that anymore. Schools foster
      individuality and children are encouraged to know their
      favourite colour and their favourite cereals. Individual
      ownership of all things is encouraged and so we grow to
      nurture our own space and our own ways. Helping others
      becomes an effort, we are going out of our way; it is taking
      away something from us and we can come to resent it.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">When we help others or say yes to their requests, we are
          fighting our selfishness and laziness. This is a good fight, and
          the rewards are plenty. It is satisfying to benefit someone else,
          to alleviate their distress, to fulfil their needs</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">Their happiness becomes our happiness. We feel good about
          ourselves. By helping others, we come to know that we are of
          use, that we are important. We have agency which we have
          used for the benefit of someone else. It is a duty to serve others,
          especially if they are our parents, our spouses, poorer or more
          helpless members of our community. Immigrant communities
          cannot thrive and would not have achieved their current
          success without the support and generosity of their more able,
          better educated, and more privileged members. Helping each
          other is a means of our survival.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">But there is a downside to this and one which you have
          identified. In helping others, we can neglect ourselves. In
          lending a hand to strangers, we can fall short in our
          responsibilities to ourselves and our own immediate family.
          Your fear of giving offence and your guilt are warning signs. It
          is time to draw the line, to back away. If you don’t, the
          consequences will be even more problematic. Resentment,
          irritability with requests, a sense of grandiosity, a mistaken
          belief that you are irreplaceable or that if you do not help, no
          one else can. You might also be unwittingly fostering
          dependence and laziness, rather than encouraging people to
          help themselves and pointing them towards greater
          empowerment. Even more dangerous would be a growing
          hostility against those you have helped. In the Qur’an, Allah
          Almighty tells us to spend on the poor, to give and to help but
          there is also a stark warning that we must not follow our
          good deeds with harm, patronizing or rubbing the help in their
          faces.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">Your letter reminded me of an iftar at the mosque. One of
          the ladies who was serving the meal was fatigued and
          overwhelmed. When asked for an extra piece of cutlery, she
          lashed out and started to shout about how she is doing her best
          etc. Her outburst was full of resentment, a sense of injustice
          that she had already given far too much and should not be
          expected to do more. Her raised voice shattered the peace of
          the happy, special moments of breaking the fast. It left a bad
          taste in everyone’s mouth. Better if she had not been helping at
          all. Better if she had sat in a corner nursing her headache and
          eating her dates. We could have well managed without her;
          there was no need for a scene.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">When it comes to your needs versus the needs of others
          balance is important. Instead of being afraid that you won’t be
          asked to help in the future, it is wiser to fear the anger that can
          grow in you if you continue to unfairly neglect yourself.
          Instead of hesitating to give a polite, controlled ‘no’ to a
          request, it is wiser to guard against the more serious offence of
          grudgingly giving help under a cloud of a festering resentment.
          Think of your capacity to help others as a muscle. If you strain
          it, it will ache and put you out of action. If you don’t use it at all,
          it will weaken. Keep it fit and healthy, strengthen it so that it
          can do more, train is so that it can function more efficiently.
          And remember that our egos are trying to trip us all the time.</p>
