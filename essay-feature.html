<p>There are two scenes that are stuck in my head. One: heaven. Two:
    hell. One: Eve in the dirt. Two: Eve eating the fruit. One: breaking
    fast. Two: the papery skin of the date. One: a garden. Two: a storm.
    When I imagine the future, neither heaven nor hell, I think of
    laying on a twin bed with a t-shirt rolled up to my bra and showing
    peachy-pink stomach rolls and a map plastered on the ceiling,
    throwing push-pins up. What was it Surah Naba said? The
    mountains as pegs? The sky as a blanket? I hope the pins stick and
    that they don’t fall onto me, get absorbed into my skin. I am full of
    metal already, keeping me on Earth, stuck in its magnetic field.</p>
<p>One: the Prophet turning away the blind man from his service.
    Two: his wife collecting his sweat and saying it smelled like musk.
    When Gabriel cleaned the Prophet’s heart, I wondered if there was
    cholesterol, or just the black of sin as he lowered it into the golden
    basin of zamzam.</p>
<p>One: holy water. Two: hating how it tastes. There is a history to a
    family, and mine is poked through with heart issues and brain
    issues and diabetes type two issues and a migration from Yemen.
    I wonder if they went by boat or by land or if anyone had a heart
    attack on the way, like my uncle with a pacemaker in his chest.</p>
<p>The doctor said, gently, so gently, <span class="feature-italic">you’re perfectly healthy, honey,</span>
    despite the fat on my stomach, and then they pricked me with Pfizer,
    pinching the thickest part of my shoulder. The nurse asks my mother
    if there were any changes to the family history. One: the Prophet
    eating the meat of a dead whale washed ashore to prove it’s halal.
    Two: beer-battered fish on the beach. My mother says no, only the
    regular myriad of cancers and the plethora of pain. I think the white
    girl who speaks up in history class will never understand how things
    slide in my blood: heady with cholesterol, heavy with ancestral pleas.
    </p>
<p>One: the rivers of milk in heaven. Two: the fire of hell, where
    sweetness leaves us. There are two scenes that are stuck in my head.
    One: heaven in pitch black. Two: hell in pitch black. There is nothing
    in my mind but fatty acid. Heaven and hell both taste like fresh
    pakora and gulab jamun in rose syrup: heaven, when it hits your
    tongue; hell, the morning after. Here’s the pin in my stomach. It said
    to go to Mangalore and eat parathas, dip it in the monsoon water
    from the side of the street. It’s no zamzam, but a homeland is holy all
    the same. Heaven and hell and homeland all look the same in
    omega-three: scrawled in India ink, tar-black. The whale's stomach
    left Jonah in the dark. God fed him fruit afterwards; let the sweet
    juice slide down his throat.</p>
<p>Praise be</p>
<p>for the stomach and the tongue and clogged arteries –</p>
<p>I think it's all tradition in tar.</p>
