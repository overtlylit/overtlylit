          <h2 class="submit-heading">What We Publish</h2>
          <p>We publish <span class="bold">flash fiction, short fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction and artwork</span>. We're open to most genres. We have a few specific guidelines we ask you to follow.</p>
          <h4 class="submit-heading">What kind of work we're interested in:</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Original work that has an element of faith or spirituality</li>
              <li>Faith does not have to be the main point of the piece, but it needs to be included to some degree</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, your character might be of a particular faith and casually mentions this in conversation. Or you might be exploring the world of existential questions. Big or small, we want it all!</p>
          <p><span class="bold">We welcome work from authors of all faiths or no faith.</span> We ask that your work be respectful of religion and that any negative experiences be written in a tasteful and mature manner.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="submit-heading">We're NOT looking for:</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Work that is offensive, especially to any marginalised groups</li>
              <li>Content that depicts gratuitous violence/sex/erotica. We will delete your submission and block your email without response</li>
              <li>Any element of plagiarism</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="bold">If your work requires a content warning, we'd appreciate it if you could put this at the top of your submission.<p>
          <br>
          <p>You can read our editors' bios to find out the kinds of work we'd love to see, but you are most welcome to submit anything outside of this too. If you're not too sure whether your work would be a good fit for us, don't self reject! Submit to us anyway as you never know where your work will take you.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Please note our word count limits for fiction and CNF are the 'sweet spot' of what we want to read; they are not absolute. Keep in mind any work over 5,000 words is unlikely to be accepted.</p>
