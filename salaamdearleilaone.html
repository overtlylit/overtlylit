    <h4 class="sdl-tag">Salaam Dear Leila</h4>
    <p class="sdl-question">In the last year or so I’ve started taking writing more
        seriously and alhamdulilah I’ve had some small but
        meaningful achievements. As a mother of a young child, I
        plan carefully to set time aside for my writing. Sometimes I
        feel selfish for doing so. Writing is just for me. I’m aware it’s
        highly unlikely I’ll ever be able to make a steady income out
        of it, however small, and therefore contribute financially
        through writing. Sometimes I feel like I should stop writing,
        that it’s a waste of time because there’s no benefit to
        anyone. But then there are times when a reader will tell me
        something they loved or related to in something I wrote and
        that makes it all worthwhile for me. Am I selfish for
        prioritising my writing, should I spend the time on something
        more worthwhile if I can’t make a career out of it?</p>
      <h4 class="sdl-tag">Jamila</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="sdl-answer">
    <h4 class="sdl-tag">Dear Jamila</h4>
    <p class="sdl-para">You are not being selfish. It’s a blessing to have a meaningful activity
      which you enjoy and which you feel is worthwhile. Being a mother is
      one of the most challenging roles in life and having time for yourself
      is healthy and uplifting. You are so right, though, about the unsteady
      income. In a survey carried out by the Society of Authors, the average
      annual earnings of a professional author was 10,500 pounds, well
      below the minimum wage. Unsurprisingly, only 13.7% of authors
      earned their income solely from writing. So, surviving as a writer will
      entail having an income that comes from a source other than the
      writing</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">In the not-so-distant past, it was quite respectable for women to be
          housewives. Talented housewives pursued hobbies and sometimes
          these hobbies took off and generated income. Nowadays, young
          women feel an obligation to share or at least contribute to their
          family’s expenses. This is fine, but as Muslim women, it is worth
          reminding ourselves that we have a God-given right to be maintained
          by our husbands according to their means. We should not feel
          obligated to contribute, it is a choice we make freely, without
          pressure. After all, we are already looking after the children, running
          households and providing stability for the community – all this is
          ‘work’ and hours of our lives that should not be taken for granted.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">In every economy, at any point of time, there will be people who are
          unemployed. It is a fact that there are simply not enough jobs for
          everyone. You, a busy mother who enjoys writing, could be, by
          choosing voluntary unemployment, giving up a potential job to
          someone else who needs it more. In this case, in a roundabout way,
          you are benefitting another family.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">But it is not all about finances, the writing life is full of rejection and
          loneliness. Career tracks are undefined as are expectations. It is a
          needy life because writers need readers, and readers are not easy to
          find. You rightly point out the satisfaction you get when readers
          respond to your work. Writing is communication and few writers are
          content to write without a readership. This is where publishing comes
          in and fierce competition. Readers’ time is limited. If they read X, they
          might not have time to read Y or Z.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">Your query does not include any angst over how good or not a writer
          you are. You are confident about your abilities. Your recent
          achievements have bolstered you and this is the momentum you will
          need to keep going. I have observed, over the years that talent is not
          enough to achieve success. Drive, ambition, perseverance, self-belief,
          and the willingness to sacrifice tends to matter more, in the long run,
          than innate ability. Also writing the relevant thing at the right time,
          luck, providence, endorsement. All these factors play a role.</p>
      <p class="sdl-para">I would not advise you to stop writing. It is too big a sacrifice and you
          might end up feeling resentful. You don’t need swaths of time to
          write. Even if you must have a day job, an hour of writing here and
          there can still be productive. Becoming a professional writer is one of
          the cheapest start-ups, all that is needed is a laptop. But beware of
          other costs – all the courses, retreats, services, etc that target the
          beginner writer. To ease your conscience, do also explore careers
          that are related to writing, ones that can provide a steady income.
          You might enjoy working in an arts organization or the publishing
          industry, working as a librarian or in a bookshop. Pursue all avenues
          and see which one opens up to you. Wanting to write and not being
          able to write can be hugely frustrating. At the same time, the need to
          write could diminish, if you find creative fulfilment elsewhere.</p>
